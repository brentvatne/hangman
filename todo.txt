continue? who knows


-fix load paths and loading of sample puzzle: scattered everywhere
-move loading logic entirely out of the Hangman class- should accept some object with accessible 'dot' properties for the info we need
-hangman shouldn't know about the model implementation i choose- this should all be separate, just have a defined interface
